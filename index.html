  <h1>Lillian Lam</h1>
  <p><em>An <strong>education</strong> degree graduate who would like to catch up with the advanced technology development by making good use of an <em><strong><a href="https://odearmusic.com/">online platform</a></strong></em> to polish her writing style and tech skills, as well as promoting goods in music learning.</em></p>
  <p><em>During the leisure time, I listen and play classical music, read autobiographies and education-related journals. Occassionally, I go to museums and concerts to refresh my minds so that I am able to mull over some difficult or complex problems faced</em>.</p>
